# PRODIGY_ML_01 â€“ House Price Prediction

## Internship Task â€“ Prodigy InfoTech (Machine Learning)

This project is completed as part of the **Machine Learning Internship** at **Prodigy InfoTech**.

Task Objective:
Build a **Linear Regression** model to predict house prices using a given dataset.
ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview:
- The dataset contains various features of houses such as:
  - GrLivArea â€“ Above ground living area (sq. ft)
  - BedroomAbvGr â€“ Number of bedrooms above ground
  - FullBath â€“ Number of full bathrooms
  - SalePrice â€“ The target variable (house price)
##  Model Used:
- **Algorithm**: Linear Regression (Scikit-learn)
- **Workflow**:
  1. Load and inspect dataset
  2. Feature and target selection
  3. Train-test split
  4. Model training
  5. Prediction and evaluation
  6. Visualization

##  Evaluation Metrics:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **RÂ² Score**
- A scatter plot showing **Actual vs Predicted House Prices**
